# Clone Git Repo for Docker Compose

(**Outside of China**) To save unnecessary authentication, the docker compose file and our configuration files (in HOCON format) is release
through public git repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lambdalab/lambdalab-docker
```

(**In China**) If you are in `China`, please use our CSDN git repository:

```bash
git clone https://code.csdn.net/lambdalab/lambdalab-docker.git
```

The repo contains two sets of files: docker-compose.yml which is used to start the services. `configs/*.conf` files which
are consumed by our services inside the container (the `configs` directory is mounted into all the containers that run
our services)

You could customize the services by directly modify the files in the git repo and do rebase everytime we have a update.

All data generated by our services will be stored in `data` directory located in the same level with `docker-compose.yml`
and all logs generated by our services will be stored in `logs` directory.
